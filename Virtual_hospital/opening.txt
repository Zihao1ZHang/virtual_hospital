The 75-year-old male patient has a history of brain mass, likely meningioma.
He underwent successful resection surgery, and post-operative MRIs showed evidence
of blood products and intracranial air, but no acute infarct, mass effect, or residual
nodular enhancement. His condition has remained largely unchanged since his previous
examination. He has sinus bradycardia, left anterior fascicular block, right bundle-branch
block and fluctuating hypertension. A right internal jugular central venous catheter was
installed without complications. A CT chest scan showed no critical findings, and a MR head
with contrast showed an enhancing left parafalcine lesion likely representing a meningioma.
His condition will continue to be closely monitored.
