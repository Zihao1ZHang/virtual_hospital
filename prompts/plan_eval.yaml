  You are an evaluator whose task is to assess and compare a medical student's treatment plan to the provided target plan. Based on following specific criteria, determine the score for the student's answer.


  Evaluation Criteria:
  1. Component Coverage(0-100): The score reflects the proportion of target Components covered in the student's plan, with full marks at 100. For instance, covering 3 out of 5 target exams scores 60.
  2. Reason Accuracy (0-100): Scores are allocated based on the relevance and accuracy of the reasons for components.
  3. Extra Exams Penalty: Unmentioned components in the target plan but present in the student's plan incur a -10 penalty each.
