  Assessment and Plan
     A/P: 75yo M w/stage IV lung cancer, DM type 2, afib, HTN, CRI p/w
     pleuritic CP, PNA, hypotention and afib with RVR.
     .
     # Hypotension: Pt has been off pressors since 9pm last night.  Received
     Diltiazem this AM for HR in 120s.  BP dropped to 80s systolic.  Pt is
     asymptomatic, feels well.
     - will transfuse 1 unit PRBCs for fluid resuscitation.  NS will likely
     be excreted given SIADH.  Will hold on restarting pressors until
     effects of Dilt wear off as pt is asymptomatic.
     - f/u blood cultures
     - continue Vanc, Zosyn, for possible sepsis; levo stopped given
     legionella antigen negative
     - continue to monitor on tele
     - holding enalapril
     - Continue digoxin for rate control to minimize BP effect
     - consider restarting B-blocker for rate control once BP improves
     .
     # Decreased WBCs: Not yet neutropenic; however decreased WBCs likely
     from chemotherapy on Monday.
     - check diff today
     - will continue to monitor for neutropenia
     .
     # PNA:  Pt is immunospupressed with recent chemo therapy although not
     neutropenic at this time.  Pleural effusion was exudative, but not an
     empyema.
     -cont. Vanc, Zosyn; Levo stopped
     - f/u blood and urine cultures
     - f/u pleural effusion cytology
     .
     # Pleuritic CP: Patient likely has PNA with fever, elevated WBC,
     pleuritic pain and productive cough. CTA did not show infiltrate
     specifically but lung mass makes asessment difficult and pt is at risk
     for post-obstructive PNA. CTA neg for PE. Alternatively, pt's CP may be
     secondary to tumor irritation of the pleura although this should not
     cause fever and leukocytosis. EKG w/o ischemic changes and trop neg.
     - tx pain as below
     .
     # Anemia: HCT stable at  24 today.  Patient is guiac negative, no
     reports of bleeding.  Possibly multifactorial with dilutional effect
     from 3L NS and recent chemotherapy.
     - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs this AM
     - maintain active type and screen
     .
     # Afib: Digoxin started yesterday.  Pt was tachy this AM in the 120s,
     responded to Dilt but dropped BP.  Will reassess and consider b-blocker
     in the PM.  Patient is not anticoagulated [**2-15**] lung mass and prior
     hemoptysis.
     - Digoxin load then dose daily
     - avoid albuterol
     - consider B-blocker this afternoon; would not continue with diltiazem
     given concern of hypotension
     .
     # Non-small cell lung ca: LLL mass with met to spine s/p radiation
     - stop zofran and switch to compazine per oncology recs.  Cont. ativan
     prn to avoid nausea
     - hydrocodone or tramadol PRN
     - will continue study trial medication Anamorelin
     .
     # COPD:
     - cont advair
     - exhange ipratropium for tioroptrium
     - avoid albuterol for now
     .
     # DM 2:
     - not on medications
     - SSI
     .
     # hx CRI: creatinine at baseline
     .
     #) Prophylaxis: sc heparin, bowel regimen
     .
     #) FEN: regular diet; 1L NS with KCl today; replete other lytes.
     - nutrition consult for poor PO intake
     .
     #) Access: PIVs
     .
     #) Code Status: Full
     .
     #) Dispo: pending further work-up and treatment; may be called out to
     floor later today (OMED)
