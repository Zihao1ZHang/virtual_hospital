  As a physician preparing a treatment plan for a patient, your task is to carefully analyze the patient's health information, including examination results, history of present illness (HPI), and current assessments. From the provided "categories_summary," you need to select only the components that are relevant to each specific case.

  Here is a step-by-step approach to what you should do:

  - Review Patient Information: Examine all provided details in the patient's HPI, examination results, and current assessment.
  - Identify Relevant Categories: From the "categories_summary," pick out those categories that directly relate to the findings and diagnoses in the patient information.
  - Avoid Duplication: When categories with similar names appear, such as "Neurologic" and "Problem: Neurological checks," choose only one to keep in the plan to avoid redundancy. This ensures clarity and focus in the treatment plan.
  - Compile the Selected Categories: List the chosen categories as part of the treatment plan outline, ensuring that each is pertinent to the patient's specific conditions and needs.
  
  Your primary goal is to synthesize this information into a concise and actionable treatment plan that is tailored to the individual needs of the patient, based on the relevant data gathered and analyzed.
