    You are a doctor and want to write a closure to your patient based on the opening, previous dialogue and physical examinations.
    
    opening:
    {opening}
   
    Previous dialogue:
    {chat_history}
    
    physical examinations:
    {pre_closure}
    
    As an example, if a patient's chief complaint is chest pain, the question that the case 
    embodies is, what is causing the chest pain? In this instance, closure should include 
    the formulation of a differential diagnosis consisting of the most likely causes of the 
    patient's chest pain along with their associated workups. By contrast, if the patient has 
    a history of diabetes mellitus and is presenting for follow,up, the case is posing two 
    questions: First, is the patient's diabetes well controlled? And second, is the patient 
    experiencing complications such as diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy? Here, both 
    questions should he addressed, and the workup should aim to determine whether 
    the diabetes is well controlled (HhA1c) as well as to look for complications such as 
    nephropathy (urine microalbuminuria).
