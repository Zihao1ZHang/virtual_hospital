. HEENT exams
• What to say to the patient before and during the exam:
• "I am going to gently press certain areas of your face. Let me know if you feel
any pain." (Examination of the maxillary, frontal, and ethmoidal sinuses.)
• "I would like to examine your eyes now:·
• "I am going to shine this light in your eyes. Would you please look straight at
the wall?"
• "I need to examine your ears now:
• "Would you please open your mouthr I need to check the inside of your
mouth and your throat."
• What to perform during the HEENT exams
• Head:
1. Inspect the head for signs of trauma and scars.
2 Palpate the head (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital) for tenderness
or abnormalities. Palpate different sections of the head one at a rime, not
simultaneously, and each rime ask, "Any paint'
• Eyes:
1. Inspect the sclerae and lower palpebral conjunctivae for color and irrita,
rion. Instruct the patient to 1ook down" and 1ook up."
2. Check the pupils for symmetry and reactivity to light. Instruct the patient
to "Please look straight at the wall when I shine a light in your eyes."
3. To check the extraocular movements of the eyes, instruct the patient to
follow your finger while standing 3 feet away in front of the patient. Make
a wide "H'' in the air with patient gazing initially to the center, then to the
right, up, down, then move your finger to the extreme left without stop,
ping, then up, and down. Eye movement should be conjugate and symmet,
ric at all times.
4. To check for nystagmus, you can pause your finger during upward gaze
and lateral gaze.
5. Check visual acuity with the Snellen eye chan.
6. Perform a funduscopic exam. Remember the rule "right,right,right'' (oph,
thalmoscope in examiner's right hand-patient's right eye-examiner's
right eye) and the rule ieft,left,left" (ophthalmoscope in examiner's left
hand-patient's left eye-examiner's left eye). You may dim the lights be,
fore funduscopic exam and instruct the patient to look at a distant object.
Ophthalmoscope should be 6 inches and at 25° to the right of the patient
to examine the right eye. Begin from outer comer of the patient's eye and
look for red reflex. Repeat the maneuver on the left eye.
• Ears:
1. Conduct an external ear inspection for discharge, skin changes, or masses.
Inform the patient, "I am looking at your ear now."
2 Palpate the external ear for pain (otitis extema); do the same for the mas,
toid. Inform the patient, "I am going to touch your ear, let me know if you
feel any pain."
3. Examine the ear canal and the tympanic membrane using an otoscope.
(Don't forget to use a new speculum for each patient.) Inform the patient,
"I am going to pull on your ear and place this instrument inside to look
deep in your ear. Let me know if there is any pain."
4. To conduct the Rinne and Weber tests, strike the tuning fork and state,
"I am going to place this instrument on your head. Do you hear it equally
on both sidesr If there is a difference in hearing in one ear, then strike the
tuning fork again and state, ''I'm going to place this behind your ear, let me
know when you stop hearing it," Then hold it about 6 inches away from
the ear and ask patient if they still hear it. Instruct them to inform you
when they stop hearing it.
• Nose:
1. To inspect the nose, instruct the patient to "Please tilt your head backwards
so that I may examine the inside of your nose."
2 To palpate the nose and sinuses, instruct the patient, "I am going to press
over your face. Please let me know if you feel any pain."
3. Inspect the nasal turbinates and the nasal septum with a light source. You
may use an otoscope for this purpose. (Do not introduce otoscope inside
of the nose.)
• Mouth and throat:
1. Have the light source ready and say:
a. "Please open your mouth."
b. "Stick out your tongue."
c. Say "aahhh."
d. "Lift it up."
2. Look for mucosal ulcers, and inspect the uvula and under the tongue for
masses.
Cardiovascular exam:
What to say to the patient before and during the exam;
• "I need to listen to your heart:'
• "Would you hold your breath, pleaser'
• "Would you sit up, please?"
• "Please look to your left."
• "I will raise the sheet now, to look at your legs:'
• "I am going to touch your feet to feel for your pulses:'
What to perform during the cardiovascular exam;
• When examining the heart, do not lift up the patient's gown. Rather, pull the
gown down the shoulder, exposing only the area to be examined.
• Listen to the carotids for bruits. (Classically the bell of the stethoscope is used
to listen for slow, turbulent blood flow, but the diaphragm is also acceptable in
this scenario.)
• Look for JVD. Remember to raise the head of the bed to 45 degrees.
• Palpate the chest for the PMI, retrostemal heave, and thrills. For this purpose,
instruct female patients to lift up their left breast and instruct obese male pa·
tients to sit up straight.
• Listen to heart sounds at all four cardiac areas (APTM). (You may listen to
the mitral area with the patient on his/her left side.) Make sure each cardiac
area is examined for three seconds. You can say this in your head, "one one•
thousand, two one·thousand, three one·thousand."
• Listen to the base of the heart with the patient leaning forward.
• Check for pedal edema.
• Check the peripheral pulses.
• Advanced techniques such as pulsus paradoxus or the Valsalva maneuver are
time·consuming and unlikely to provide essential information.
3. Pulmonary exam;
• What to say to the patient before and during the exam:
• "I need to listen to your lungs now:·
• "Please take a deep breath for me."
• "Please say '99' for me."
• "I am going to tap on your back to check your lungs:'
• What to perform during the pulmonary exam:
• Inspect: Examine the shape of the chest, respiratory pattern, and deformities.
• Palpate: Look for tenderness and tactile fremitus.
• Percuss over the back and look for diaphragmatic excursions and dullness.
• Auscultate for egophony, wheezes, and crackles.
• Examine both the front and the hack of the chest.
• Don't percuss or auscultate through the patient's gown.
• Don't percuss or auscultate over the scapula. Rather, have the patient hug
him/hersel£ so the scapula is outlined.
• Allow a full inspiration and expiration in each area of the hack and chest.
4. Abdominal exam:
• What to say to the patient before and during the exams
• "I need to examine/look at your stomach now:'
• "I am going to listen to your stomach now:'
• "I am going to press on your stomach lightly. Tell me if you feel any pain or
discomfort:' {Palpate on epigastric area as well.)
• "I'm going to press a little deeper. Let me know if there's any pain: {Do not
perform deep palpation on epigastric area.)
• "Now I need to tap on your stomach."
• "Do you feel any pain when I press in or when I let go? Which hurts more?"
• What to perform during the abdominal exam:
• Inspect for symmetry, dilated veins, previous surgical scars, and skin abnor~
malities.
• Auscultate {always auscultate before you palpate the abdomen).
• Percuss for ascites and liver span.
• Palpate: Start from the point that is farthest from the pain; be gentle on the
painful area, and don't try to elicit the pain again once the area of tenderness is
located. Check for rebound tenderness, CVA tenderness, the obturator sign,
the psoas sign, and Murphy's sign.
5. Neurologic exam:
• What to say to the patient before and during the exam-mini-mental status
exam questionss
• "I would like to ask you some questions to test your orientation:'
• "I would like to check your memory and concentration by asking you some
questions."
• "What is your name and age?"
• "Where are you now?"
• "What is the date todayr
• Show the patient your pen and ask, "What is this?"
• "Now I would like to ask you some questions to check your memory."
• "I will name three objects for you, and I want you to repeat them immediately
and after 30 seconds, okay! Chair, bed, and pen." (Tests immediate memory
and short~term memory.)
• "What did you have for lunch yesterday?" (Tests recent memory.)
• "When did you get marriedr (Tests distant memory.)
• "Now please repeat for me the names of the three objects that I mentioned to
you:' (Tests short~term memory.)
• "Are you left~ handed or right~ handed("
